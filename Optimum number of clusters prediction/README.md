**Dataset Information**

The dataset consists of three species of Iris Flowers that are Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica and gives information on 4 features of these three species - SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength and PetalWidth. The task to apply K Mean algorithm and divide the flowers into different clusters based on the features.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

**INTRODUCTION**

In this ML work we predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually from the given ‘Iris’ dataset. We also make some observations from the heatmap and plots obtained.

**Conclusion**

In this project we have performed a detailed analysis and visualization of the training dataset with different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques. To find the right number of clusters following steps were performed.

The elbow method runs k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of values for k.

Finding Centroid for each cluster
Before visualizing the clusters, we first have to find the centroid for each cluster

Finally, visualisation of centroids plot is obtained.
