**Bitcoin Data Analysis & Prediction**

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
-  Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.
-   Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. 



**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to analyse and predict prices of bitcoin using historical data.

**DATASET**

- Step 3: Data Training & Model Creation
- Step 4: Performance Evaluation




**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)

**Accuracy of different models used**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.94
 ```
