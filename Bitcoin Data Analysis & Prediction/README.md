# **Bitcoin Data Analysis & Prediction**

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
-  Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.
-   Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. 

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to analyse and predict prices of bitcoin using historical data.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory?select=coin_Bitcoin.csv).

**WHAT I HAVE DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Visualization
- Step 3: Data Training & Model Creation
- Step 4: Performance Evaluation


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)

**Accuracy of different models used**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.94
 ``` 
**Conclusion drawn**
Conclusion Drawn through analysis & prediction:

- HIGH of BITCOIN went up after a certain duration and we can also observe a steep in it's HIGH as well as LOW.
- High and low were constant.
- We can also observe steep in OPEN and CLOSE of BITCOIN.
- By using linear regression model, we got an accuracy of 99.94 % which is really a good accuracy.
