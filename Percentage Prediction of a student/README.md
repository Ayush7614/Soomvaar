**Dataset Information**

The dataset is about the correspondance between the number of hours student has studied to scores obtained. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. The dataset can also be downloaded from 'http://bit.ly/w-data'

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

**INTRODUCTION**

In this ML work we predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours. Also obtain a heat map and
other plots for better understanding of the result.

**MODELS USED**

- Linear Regression - \_A machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

**Conclusion**

In this project we have performed a detailed analysis and visualization of the training dataset with different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques. Then a comaprative analysis of different Regressons have been done to predict the student's percentage.

Also a question is solved at the end for better understanding of the model and it's results.
