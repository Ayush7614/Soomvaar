        "# **Password Strength Classification.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Password strength is a measure of the effectiveness of a password against guessing or brute-force attacks. \n",
        "- In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.\n",
        "- The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using strong passwords lowers overall risk of a security breach, but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective security controls.\n",
        "-  The effectiveness of a password of a given strength is strongly determined by the design and implementation of the factors (knowledge, ownership, inherence). \n",
        "\n",
        "In this project we will classify strength of password as three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong using machine learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps followed in this project are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Step 1 Data preprocessing & exploration.\n",
        "- Step 2 Data preparation.\n",
        "- Step 3 Data Training & model creation.\n",
        "- Step 4 Performance evaluation using error & accuracy check."
